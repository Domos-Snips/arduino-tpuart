Arduino EIB/KNX Interface via TP-UART
=====================================


This is a very first version of an interface between Arduino and EIB/KNX using the TP-UART interface and Arduino library.


Hardware
--------

We leverage Siemens BCU 5WG1117-2AB12 - for about 30â‚¬

Software
--------

The Arduino library is found in the directory `KnxTpUart` and can be directly placed in Arduino's library folder. It is currently in a very early alpha state and undergoes constant change. I recommend not to trust on it as of now.
